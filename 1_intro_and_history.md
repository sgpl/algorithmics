# 1: Introduction and Historical Review

- digital computers - even the most modern and complex ones - are a large collection of switches. 
- these switches or bits, are not "flipped" by the user, but by the computer themselves. 
- each bit can have a value of **0** or **1**. 
- the process and algorithm that prescribes the trivial operations on bits makes computers perform incredible feats. 

### some gastronomy 

- ingredients are the input
- cake is the output
- recepie is the algorithm 
- "algorithm prescribes the activities that constitute the process."


- recepies and algorithms relevant to the processes are called software
- utensils and ovvens represent what is known as hardware. 

- many everyday processes are governed by algorithms 
	- changing a tyre
	- filing income tax
	- etc
