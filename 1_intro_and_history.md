# 1: Introduction and Historical Review

- digital computers - even the most modern and complex ones - are a large collection of switches. 
- these switches or bits, are not "flipped" by the user, but by the computer themselves. 
- each bit can have a value of **0** or **1**. 
- the process and algorithm that prescribes the trivial operations on bits makes computers perform incredible feats. 

### some gastronomy 

- ingredients are the input
- cake is the output
- recepie is the algorithm 
- "algorithm prescribes the activities that constitute the process."


<h6>algorithmics is the term used to describe the area of human study, knowledge and expertise that concerns algorithms.</h6>

<h3>Algorithmics and Computer Science</h3>

- Algorithmics is the code of computer science. 
- Some of the topics in the book go into problems that computers cannot solve. 
- goal of book: is to help with acquiring a deep understanding of the fundamentals of machine-executable processes and the reciped or algorithms that govern them. 

<h4>Some History</h4>

- around 400-300 BC, Euclid invented an algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two positive nos. <b>(Euclidian Algorithm is considered the first non-trivial algorithm.)</b>

- first hardware controlled by algorithms: Joseph Jacquard 

- recepies and algorithms relevant to the processes are called software
- utensils and ovvens represent what is known as hardware.
